# Tripling Nuclear and Renewable Energy: A Korean Perspective

This repository accompanies the research paper titled  
**"Assessing the Consistency of Simultaneous Tripling of Nuclear and Renewable Energy Capacity in Korea: Evidence from the IPCC AR6 Scenarios."**

## Overview

At COP28, the global community—including Korea—pledged to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030 and nuclear capacity by 2050. This repository provides the data and analysis behind our systematic evaluation of how Korea’s national electricity plans align with these global targets, using a subset of Korea-specific scenarios from the IPCC AR6 database.

## Repository Contents

This GitHub repository contains:
- The **data** used in the analysis, derived from the IPCC AR6 Scenario Database and Korea's energy-related statistics
- The **code** for scenario filtering, capacity projection analysis, and figure generation

## Key Contributions

- **Scenario Analysis**: Evaluation of 198 Korea-specific scenarios from the IPCC AR6 database (65 Paris-compliant and 133 non-compliant).
- **Policy Benchmarking**: Comparison between Korea’s 11th Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand and global mitigation pathways.
- **Tripling Pledge Feasibility**: Assessment of whether Korea’s clean energy targets are consistent with global tripling goals.
- **Findings**:  
  - Renewable energy tripling by 2030 is plausible in many scenarios.  
  - Nuclear energy tripling by 2050 is rare in most global pathways.  
  - Korea’s plan aligns with global goals for renewables, but diverges on gas reliance and ambitious nuclear expansion.
